# ParkingLotSelfSpringBoot
I was given the following problem statement:

You have to design a parking lot which will have these details

Single level parking
Capacity of the parking lot is fixed and will not change on runtime
Type of vehicles can be made fixed (say car parking)
Actions to be performed

Vehicle checkin
Vehicle checkout
Search for a particular vehicle
Search for available spaces
Please note these are the minimum features you need to work on but if time permits and you can add more features it will add extra points for you.

The implementation should be a working code and should be driven by user input. Input can be taken any way (suggestion for Command Line Interface)
You are free to use any IDE you want, language should be Java.

Code will be evaluated on

Working
Design
Extensibility
